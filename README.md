The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) 
for three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
